## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is crucial in understanding public opinion and market sentiment in the financial domain. This project aims to fine-tune a BERT model, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model, to perform sentiment analysis on financial texts.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   
  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-sentiment-analysis.git
      cd financial-sentiment-analysis
  ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   
   ```bash
      jupyter notebook financial_sentiment_analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions and code within the Jupyter Notebook to fine-tune and evaluate the BERT model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is available in the /dataset directory. You can also replace it with your own financial sentiment dataset.
